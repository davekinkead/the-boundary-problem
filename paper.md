# What's the Problem with the Boundary Problem

Motivated by the crossed wires at my AAP presentation.  There appear to be considerably different conceptions of what the Boundary Problem is.  These differences contribute to the problems current intractability.

A rough outline....


### What is the Boundary Problem?

The Boundary Problem refers to the challenge of adequately justifying democratic inclusion. Where should we draw our borders and why? Who exactly should be considered amongst the people?  Who gets to vote? And who should have a say in answering these questions?  Who ought be included in the _demos_ and who ought be excluded has a profound effect on the realisation of justice, the coherence of democratic theory, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  

These questions cannot be answered democratically.  Any democratic process presupposes the existence of some determinant group of people, _the people_, who constitute the participants of that process. Democratic answers are therefore, either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Non-democratic solutions fair little better.  A number of principles to settle the question - historical accident, nationality, cultural or linguistic salience, the all-coerced principle, and the all-affected principle - have been proposed but none offer an adequate solution. Despite the best efforts of political theorists in the last 30 years, no adequate solution to the boundary problem has been identified.  

I argue that the paucity of answers is a result of the Boundary Problems being not one but a set of distinct but interrelated problems, each of which challenges different normative aspects of political philosophy in different ways.


### The Bootstrapping Problem

The Boundary Problem can't be solved democratically. Any democratic process presupposes the existence of some determinant group of people, _the people_, who constitute the participants of that process. Democratic answers are therefore, either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.


### The Justice Problem 

The Boundary Problem as it relates to justice is closely linked to the ideas of citizenship and cosmopolitanism.

In each case, the inability to adequately justify why someone should be a member of one political group vs another results in a conflict with justice.

The cosmopolitan approach to the Boundary Problem is concerned with the fairness of different groups of being subjected to different political frameworks and the normative question of who should be included and why.


### Distributive justice 

The accidents of history and the biological lottery mean that the initial conditions of our lives, the set of rights, goods, and opportunities available to us at birth and beyond, vary greatly not just between members of our society but between members of societies themselves.

Distributive justice requires that natural, economic, legal, and social resources are distributed fairly. 

Different states and societies have different economic and political frameworks.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals having (significantly) different access to basic resources.

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with distributive justice.


### Procedural justice

_Ceteris paribus_, justice requires that the procedures of the state for resolving disputes and allocating resources be fair between people.  Equal people should be treated equally.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals being subjected to (significantly) different rules and frameworks.

Why should someone in Finland be subjected to open and transparent rule of law when their neighbours in Russia are not (if they want it).

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with procedural justice.


### Restorative justice

The actions of some affect others.  The actions of some countries affect others.  The externalities of some states (or members of those states) often result in significant harm to others outside of that state.

Restorative justice requires that those harmed be given some form or recourse to that harm.  Political participation is a form of restorative justice for subjects against the coercive power of the state.  

The Boundary Problem means that many people are denied restorative justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.


### The legitimacy problem

Many accounts of democracy justify the authority of a democratic state by way of reference to particular outcomes or states of affairs that democratic processes bring about.  A democratic authority might be a legitimate authority because democratic processes track the truth better than others (@condorcet), best promotes the common good (@mill), best realise individual preferences in groups (@???) or best ensure the needs of all members of society are realised (@sen)

The Boundary problem undermines these accounts because some accounts of inclusion are incompatible with some accounts of authority, and no consequential account of democratic authority provides a complementary/corresponding account of inclusion.
