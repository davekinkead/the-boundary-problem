# What's the Problem with the Boundary Problem?

This paper is motivated by the crossed wires I experiences during a presentation I gave at the AAP2014.  There appears to be considerably different conceptions of what the Boundary Problem is.  People seem to be approaching the problem from very different perspectives and these differences, I will argue, contribute to the current intractability of the problem.

A rough outline....


### So what's the Boundary Problem?

Where should we draw our borders and why? Who exactly should be considered amongst the people?  Who gets to vote? And who should have a say in answering these questions?  Who ought be included in the _demos_ and who ought be excluded has a profound effect on the realisation of justice, the coherence of democratic theory, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  These questions, and any relating to the normative foundations of political inclusion and jurisdiction, have become know as the Boundary Problem.

These questions cannot be answered democratically.  Any democratic process presupposes the existence of some determinant group of people, _the people_, who constitute the participants of that process. Democratic answers are therefore, either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Non-democratic solutions fair little better.  A number of principles to settle the question - historical accident, nationality, cultural or linguistic salience, the all-coerced principle, and the all-affected principle - have been proposed but none offer an adequate solution. Despite the best efforts of political theorists in the last 30 years, no adequate solution to the boundary problem has been identified.  

The intractability of Boundary Problem can be traced in part to it's name. _The Boundary Problem_, a singular proper noun with a definitive article, describes not one but a number of related problems whose causes and consequences differ depending on one's perspective.

I argue that the Boundary Problem can be better understood once we make these perspectives, and their corresponding assumptions and objectives, explicit.  This paper offers three new perspectives on the Boundary Problem through the eyes of the Democrat, the Cosmopolitan, and the Anarchist[^1].  It is my contention that viewed from these perspectives, solutions to the Boundary Problem become readily apparent.

[^1]: I use the labels Democrat, Cosmopolitan, and Anarchist very broadly.  One does not have to be an anarchist to approach the Boundary Problem from that perspective.


### The Democrat

The Democratic is concerned with:

  - the intractability of the BP with democratic theory
  - the conflict of non-democratic solutions with democratic values

The Democrat is concerned with finding a democratic solution to the Boundary Problem.  This is a challenge because it seems like the the Boundary Problem can't be solved democratically. Any democratic process presupposes the existence of some determinant group of people, _the people_, who constitute the participants of that process. Democratic answers are therefore, either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

As @arrhenius2005 notes however, there is a difference between theories as normative ideals and theories as decision procedures...

Create a Goodin vs Dahl dialog...

Borders as exogenous vs endogenous...

> "If we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." @arrhenius2005 p14

- distinguish between democratic theories, democratic processes, and democratic values.

### The Cosmopolitan

The Cosmopolitan is concerned with justice over all else.  _Ceteris paribus_, humans have equal moral worth regardless of which polity they reside in.  The cosmopolitan approach to the Boundary Problem is concerned with the fairness of different groups of being subjected to different political frameworks and the normative question of who should be included and why.  The Boundary Problem has a profound impact on individual welfare and fairness, and is therefore a challenge to the principles of justice.

In each case, the inability to adequately justify why someone should be a member of one political group vs another results in a conflict with justice.

The strategy here is to outline various conceptions of justice and show how the Boundary Problem challenges them.

The Boundary Problem can be solved for the Cosmopolitan by identifying a principle of inclusion compatible with their principles of justice (which could be the same)


### Restorative justice

The actions of some affect others.  The actions of some countries affect others.  The externalities of some states (or members of those states) often result in significant harm to others outside of that state.

Restorative justice requires that those harmed be given some form or recourse to that harm.  Political participation is a form of restorative justice for subjects against the coercive power of the state.  

The Boundary Problem means that many people are denied restorative justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.


    @simmons2013 responds that we should bite the bullet and accept that ideal theory can't deal with the boundary problem, but non-ideal theory can claim the pressing matters of distributive justice can counter the ideal problems raised by the Boundary Problem.

    "one simply cannot defend a plausible theory of domestic justice and legitimacy without first identifying the persons and territories that count as rightfully inside and rightfully outside a state’s boundaries of authority." p351


### Distributive justice 

The accidents of history and the biological lottery mean that the initial conditions of our lives, the set of rights, goods, and opportunities available to us at birth and beyond, vary greatly not just between members of our society but between members of societies themselves.

Distributive justice requires that natural, economic, legal, and social resources are distributed fairly. 

Different states and societies have different economic and political frameworks.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals having (significantly) different access to basic resources.

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with distributive justice.


### Procedural justice

_Ceteris paribus_, justice requires that the procedures of the state for resolving disputes and allocating resources be fair between people.  Equal people should be treated equally.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals being subjected to (significantly) different rules and frameworks.

Why should someone in Finland be subjected to open and transparent rule of law when their neighbours in Russia are not (if they want it).

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with procedural justice.



### The Anarchist

The Anarchist is concerned with how the Boundary Problem affects claims of political authority.  I use the label anarchist very loosely, similarly to Simmons' philosophical anarchism - anyone skeptical of political authority.

>  "If existing political boundaries fail to reflect “morally respectable” solutions to the problem of the need for localized justice, why should we take the legitimate territorial jurisdictions of existing states or the genuine political obligations of their claimed subjects to be determined by such a morally tainted process?" 
> 
> -- @simmons2013 p332

Many accounts of democracy justify the authority of a democratic state by way of reference to particular outcomes or states of affairs that democratic processes bring about.  A democratic authority might be a legitimate authority because democratic processes track the truth better than others (@condorcet), best promotes the common good (@mill), best realise individual preferences in groups (@???) or best ensure the needs of all members of society are realised (@sen)

The Boundary problem undermines these accounts because some accounts of inclusion are incompatible with some accounts of authority, and no consequential account of democratic authority provides a complementary/corresponding account of inclusion.
