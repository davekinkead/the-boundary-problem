Whelan outlines the boundary problem as "the logically prior and in some ways more fundamental question of the appropriate constitution of the _people_ or unit within which democratic governance is to be practised." p13

It is not a problem of geographic per se, "but the membership of the democratic body; or citizenry;" p14

He position is "not only that the drawing of boundaries around these units is a significant problem for democratic theory and practice, but that democratic theory itself offers no clear guidance on the matter."  The boundary problem "thus present(s) an important practical limit to the scope of democracy as a method of making collective decisions." p13

"Democracy is advanced by its advocates as the sole legitimate method for making political decisions..." but the boundary problem "...is insoluble within the framework of democratic theory..." p16 making "controversies over boundaries among the most intractable and bitter types of political conflict." p40

There is also "the second problem that the establishment of boundaries ... generally predetermines the outcomes of substantive political issues." p41


#### Argument Outline (p13)

1. Democracy always makes reference to a determinate community of people who are collectively self-governing. 
2. All democratic theory faces the logically prior question of who the people should be.
3. This problem places an important and practical limit on the scope of democracy as a collective decision making method. Who the people are often determines the outcome of any voting system.

Typical accounts of democracy are participatory, majoritarian or consent based.  But each of these accounts needs to answer the logically prior question of who will participate, who will be counted towards the majority or whose consent is needed. (p14--15)

Boundary drawing and determination of political membership is perhaps the most fundamental political decision. Yet, it is a problem completely insoluble from within the framework of democratic theory. p16

Effective democracies require broad consensus on fundamental matters of inclusion. Their boundaries must be recognised as fair and appropriate. p41


#### All-Affected Principle

Intuitively, all those affected by some policy ought have a voice in making it. (p16) The intuition is clear when burdens are to be imposed but not so clear that those receiving benefits ought have a say in the matter. (p17)

Yet, every decision affects people differently. Constituency would need to be determined on a per issue basis. p19

Deeper still, determining who is affected by an issue requires a prior determination of constituency, which cannot be made by those affected as this is the very question to be settled. p19


#### Territorial States

The people can be defined by historical accident - those in a state are the people. But this can't solve the boundary problem when territorial issues are in dispute.

"Democracy can be practiced for making collective decisions once the collectivity has been defined, but democratic methods themselves are inadequate to establish the bounds of the collectivity, whose existence democratic theory simple pre-supposes." p22


#### Consent

Constituting by consent would define the people as who ever consents to being one of them.  This is plausible for voluntary organisations but requires unanimity on who is included and who is excluded. p26

But States are territorial and compulsory associations whose agreement is never unanimous. 


#### Nationality

Nationality and ethnicity have also been suggested as ways to demarcate the people - the UN recognises the right of self-determination for peoples.  The objections to these are many:

- "No single objective criterion of nationality appears definitive." p29
- States govern many nations of people.
- State determine nations as much as nations determine states ie the Soviet people, the Yugoslavian people.
- People may wish to align themselves non-ethnically.
- The nationalist principle is non-voluntaristic. 

These reasons seem to clash with democratic values such s voluntarism, freedom and rationality. p31


#### Geography & Salience

Human distribution seems to drive grouping and connection. Those closest share common ends. Yet...

Physical features are a matter of perspective. Rivers divide as much as unite communities. Mountains are boarders only to those who live on the plains. p37
Economic patterns develop in response to political boundaries, just as much as they form common bonds. p35


#### Autonomy

Size of a democratic people determines both its citizen effectiveness and system capacity (see Dahl 1973 Size & Democracy).  Yet autonomy suffers the same problem as the all-affected principle - constituting the people on a per-issue basis, or changing them over time.

These other principles fail to 'command general respect' p40


## @dahl1989


## @arrhenius2005

The boundary problem is defined as "Who should be eligible to take part in which decision-making processes?" p1  It is a "fundamental issue in democratic theory" p1 but it is "perhaps not equally clear that the boundary problem raises problem regarding the justification and legitimacy of democracy." p2

His position is that "if we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." p14

He highlights a number of related questions: p3

  - "how we should decide the relevant political competence for membership in the political community?"

  - "who should have a right to run for office?"

  - "Another boundary problem concerns beings that lack the capacity to take part in the democratic process but who are going to be affected by policies adopted and that could be represented by proxies, for example minors and future generations"

The argument:

  - There's a difference between a normative ideal and a decision rule
  - A theory can be accepted as a normative ideal but rejected as a decision rule
  - Democracy is one such theory

"Someone who takes democracy as a practical decision method justified by a normative ideal doesn’t hold that democracy is the foundation of legitimate government but that its legitimacy derives from the ideal." p5

"If we take democracy as a practical decision method and again raise the question of who should take part in which decision procedures, it seems clear that this has to be answered by the normative ideal that motivated the choice of democracy in the first place" p7

> So it appears that instrumental accounts of democracy aren't bothered by the regress objection.

"if we see the all affected principle as part of a democratic ideal, then whether or not a decision is democratic, or whether it is more or less democratic, will depend on some conception of “relevantly affected”" p9

When taken as a normative ideal rather than a decision mechanism, the All-Affected Principle overcomes Whelan's objections. p12  Affected Interest could have some causal constraint that suggests a federal structure and objectively optimal jurisdiction boundaries.

Nozick as an interesting counterpoint to the all affected principle

> If four men propose marriage to a woman, her decision about whom ... to marry importantly affects each of the lives of those four persons, her own life, and the lives of any other person wishing to marry one of these four men, and so on. Would anyone propose, even limiting the group to include only the primary parties, that all five persons vote to decide whom she shall marry?  
>
> -- Nozick "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" p269

He does however acknowledge the all affected principle fits well with democratic conceptions that concern distribution of influence or power e.g. epistemic democracy. p14

## @goodin2007


Goodin defines the boundary problem as "How do we specify the group making those decisions?" but prefers to call it the problem of “constituting the demos.” p40 

His position is that the "democratic ideal ought ideally be to enfranchise “all affected interests.” Understood in a suitably expansive “possibilistic” way, that would mean giving virtually everyone everywhere a vote on virtually everything decided anywhere." p68

Bob argument is:

  - procedures can still be democratic if they realise democratic ideals
  - the all potentially affected interest principle realises democratic ideals of equality
  - an expansive interpretation entails a global democracy
  - a restrictive interpretation entails trans-border compensation for externalities

Democracy can be defined semi-circularly as "groups of people making collective decisions in a democratic way." p40

"“Constituting the demos” is therefore a problem that finds no ready solution, either within democratic theory or in any of the seemingly cognate areas of political philosophy." p42

"The natural place to look for a solution is indeed in the vicinity of democratic theory itself, and I shall argue that we can indeed find one there — but not without some surprises along the way." p42

"Until we have an electorate we cannot have an election. That is not just a temporal observation; it is a logical truth......like saying the winning lottery ticket will be pulled out of the hat by the winner of that selfsame lottery" p43

"The need to appeal to some principle outside democracy to constitute the demos does not render democratic theory incoherent, merely incomplete." p44

Empiric answers are difficult: "More generally, unless we know what the right way to constitute the demos is in the first place, we have no way to know whether any given empirical tendencies within democratic politics will, as this argument asserts, lead them to (re)constitute the demos in precisely the right way." p45

"Constituting a demos on the basis of shared territory or history or nationality is thus only an approximation to constituting it on the basis of what really matters, which is interlinked interests" p49

"The “all affected interests” principle is the standard by which the adequacy of those other approximations is invariably assessed." 49

"Protecting people’s interests is thus the most plausible candidate principle for bringing the “who” and the “how” of democratic politics into alignment." p50

"the “all affected interests” principle is fundamentally egalitarian, counting all interests equally; and equal political power is arguably the cornerstone of democracy....What matters is that constituting the demos in that way is consonant with our settled views about what it is to “make collective decisions in a democratic way” at the procedural level." p50

On acutal affected interests: "which interests are “actually affected” depends on who gets to vote. Hence it is incoherent to try to deter- mine who should get to vote by asking whose interests are actually affected by the course of action actually decided upon." p53

"More generally, you are rightly said to be “affected,” not merely by the “course of action actually decided upon,” but also by the range of alternative courses of action from which that course was chosen. Further- more, you are rightly said to be “affected,” not merely by what the consequences of that decision actually turn out to be, but also by what the consequences might have turned out to be" p54

"By embracing all possible worlds, politically, this expansive conception of “all possibly affected interests” causes the franchise to balloon dramatically and the scope for legitimate exclusions to shrink accordingly." p55

"Even if, per the “all affected interests” principle, we give a vote to everyone who is affected, that does not necessarily imply that the demos is empowered to decide by voting upon everything that affects its members." p62

So we can restrict the scope of democratic action on only those affected - "The “all affected interests” standard can thus be satisfied in either of two ways. One is by expanding the franchise, giving a say to all those who would be affected. Another is by restricting the power of the demos, so it is only allowed to make decisions that affect only those who do have a say." p63

The constraining version could be realised with a "not “no spillovers” but, rather, “no uncompensated spillovers.” p 66

"Purely as a matter of democratic third best, the price of not enfranchising everyone we ideally should is that we would have to pay them off for any harms we inflict upon them and accede to their demands for fair recompense for any benefits we derive from the wrongfully disenfranchised." p68


## @saunders2012

Saunders defines the boundary problem as the issue of who is to be included concerns both spatial outsiders and internal exclusions. p295

He criticizes the ‘all-affected principle’ and the claim that we must enfranchise almost everyone in almost every decision.

Saunders' key claims are: (p281)

- that we should focus on rights rather than mere interests,
- that rights are better respected by limiting the power of groups to infringe them, rather than by requiring them to include or enfranchise the rights-holders

His conclusion is that the boundary problem can be solved by accepting an arbitrary demos but limiting their scope by preventing negative externalities according to some non-democratic moral principle.

This is because "individuals may be understood as waiving certain rights where they are part of a democratic group, thus explaining why groups are able to affect their members in ways that they cannot legitimately affect outsiders." p281

History: Carl Cohen(1971:41–54), JackLively(1975:10–12), Frederick G. Whelan (1983), Giovanni Sartori (1987: 21–5), and Robert A. Dahl (1989: 119–31, 1990: 45–51). Abizadeh (2008) Arrhenius (2007) and Goodin (2007).

"Until we know the relevant group of decision-makers, it seems that there is no prospect of a genuinely democratic decision." p281

"There is no need for a decision-making group to include all who are affected by a decision." p281

"It is frequently claimed that (1) it is unjustifiable for one group to impose costs on outsiders unilaterally, so (2) those outsiders ought to be included in the decision-making process. I will argue that, while the first claim is true, the second does not follow and ought to be rejected." (p282)

All Affected Principle: "I believe it is most charitably interpreted as the claim that all those whose interests are affected ought to be enfranchised." p283

Over inclusiveness is a problem because:

- unaffected votes are _not_ likely to vote randomly. Problems like racism abound. p284
- it suggests enfranchising everyone inc children & the insane
- those unaffected can't be trusted to abstain when they should
- "dilutes the power of the locals to govern their own lives" p286

"Moral agents are actors, capable of deliberate, reasoned choice, and bound by moral requirements. Moral patients, conversely, are simply those beings deserving of moral consideration. On most views, all moral agents are also moral patients, but the reverse does not hold." p286

"Rule in the interests of the people (or affected patients) is not democracy, but guardianship. Democracy is essentially a matter of rule by the people, that is, a matter of their agency" p287

"Democracy is not simply about the equal satisfaction of different parties’ interests, but about giving people equal (and positive) inputs into what the decisions are. This is why choosing a course of action by lottery, though it shows equal respect for all people’s interests, is not democratic (see Estlund, 2008: 65–84; Goodin, 2004: 99)." p288

"It seems that democracy is, in some sense, a matter of collective agency. " p288

"Democracy is based on respecting people as agents, rather than merely as patients." p288

"All might subscribe to the democratic process because it gives weight to their preferences. They may lose on any given decision, but at least they have a chance of winning next time." p289

"Democratic arrangements are one form of social interaction that impose particular costs on particular agents on particular occasions, but can be justified because in general they are beneficial to all." p289

"Agents normally face limits on what they can permissibly do. I cannot simply push past you because I am in a rush, for example. Similar limits apply also to collective agents." p289 - this strikes me as a completely incorrect assumption. What can't I push past you, what makes it wrong?

The imposition of costs to insiders is acceptable because they gain 'net benefits in the long term'. This is not true of outsiders. p290

"Thus, the decision-making power of the demos ought to be limited to distributing benefits and burdens internally and not to affecting outsiders (negatively, at least)." p290

"The decisional power of a group need not, therefore, be limited to what does not affect outsiders, but only to what does not harm outsiders." p290

"we need not enfranchise outsiders in a decision simply because we could benefit them" p290

"there are some things that I have the right to do, even if others are adversely affected by my decision" such as business competition. p291

Acknowledges his major problem - "Of course, in practice we will need mechanisms to determine what rights people have. These will presumably be undemocratic, because we cannot have a democratic process without a prior determination of who should be included in that process, which merely opens a regress." p291

Compensation may be a viable alternative to inclusion or enfranchisement "If our action infringes on the domain of others’ rights, then we need to obtain their consent. Note that this need not take the form of including them in our democratic procedure." 292

"Simply including someone in a democratic process is not itself sufficient to allow the overriding of their rights." - Very good point p293

"Including someone in the process of decision-making does not necessarily entitle us to override their rights." p293

"Thus, it seems (1) that groups have the right to act as their members see fit, provided that they do not violate the rights of any outsiders, regardless of whose interests may be affected, and (2) that groups ought to be prohibited from violating rights without permission." p293

"If democracy requires all members of the community to be willing to bear short-term losses for the benefit of others, democratic arrangements are likely to function more smoothly where the people are united by a sense of solidarity." p294


## @abizadeh2012



## @song2012

Song defines the boundary problem as the question of "who are the people? How is the demos constituted and by what authority?" p39

Her position is cosmopolitan approaches to the boundary problem "are insufficiently attentive to the conditions of democracy. Democracy is not merely a set of procedures; it also consists of substantive values and principles." p39

"Whelan is [only] right that we are caught in a vicious circle _if_ we assume that democracy is purely procedural" p42

The Argument:

  1.  Affected Interest (AI) & Subject to Coercion (SC) view democracy as overly procedural
  2.  Democracy also includes ideals like political equality and solidarity
  3.  AI & SC undermine those ideals by creating problems of size and stability.
  4.  Therefore AI & SC are not suitable basis for bounding the demos.

She then outlines three considerations for bounding the demos: (p39)

  1. securing the constitutive conditions of democracy, 
  2. serving as the primary site of solidarity conducive to democratic participation, and 
  3. establishing clear links between representatives and their constituents.

Typical accounts that legitimate the people include:

- nationalism (see Walzer 1985)
- history (see Nasstrom 2007)
- affected interests (see Shapiro 1999, Young 2000, Gould 2004, Goodin 2007)
- subject to coercion (see Lopez-Guerra 2005, Abizadeh 2008)

Defining the demos as the state is both over and under inclusive. Over, because many not affected are given a say & under because resident aliens are not. p40

> She calls AI & SC "democratic principles of inclusion" (p40) but they would be better characterised as cosmopolitan.

Normative core of democracy includes ideals as well as processes. AI & SC accounts treat democracy as procedural. p41

Political equality & solidarity are normative cores of democracy that are adversely affected by the AI & SC. p43

"The fundamental moral presumption of democracy is that no person is intrinsically superior to another" p43

"Democracy is a collective decision making process subject to the condition of equality" p43

  - but is the equality required amongst all those subject to law or merely those who make the law?
  - does this require equality between ruler and subject?

Political equality requires protecting equal rights and liberties and ensuring equal opportunities for political influence.

The ideal deliberative procedure seeks to filter nonpublic claims from claims orientated to the common good. p44

Deliberative accounts are based on the exchange of reasons acceptable to others with different views and require the protection of nonpolitical rights as a constitutive element of democracy. p45

She makes an interesting distinction between liberal (hypothetical)justifications and democratic (actual) justifications of coercion. p51

The size of a polity inversely affects the solidarity of its people. p55  As well its stability. p56  These concerns undermine democratic solidarity.

"What the affected interests and coercion principles actually require is different demoi for different decisions." p56

Mutual trust and solidarity "provide a prima facie case for a territorial answer to the boundary problem." p59

> AI & SC are highly inclusionary and uneven. People are affected differently.  But democratic equality requires equal voice. Thus they are incompatible.

> Song completely misses the point.  Yes the demos should be bounded by the state but she doesn't explain which state should bound which demos!


## @erman2014

Erman's paper is a simple conditional: if democracy is a normative ideal, then any solution to the boundary problem must be compatible with the basic conditions of democracy.

She defines the issue as "The problem of who should be included in this collective and thus take part in the collective democratic decision-making, ... is called the boundary problem in democratic theory" p535

Her position is that "the ideal of democracy – ...democracy as collective self-determination (the ‘rule by the people’) is intrinsically justified as the ultimate foundation of legitimate authority" and that "the so-called ‘equal influence principle’ is preferable to solutions drawing on what is commonly called ‘the all affected interests principle’" p535

So "to the extent that we wish to hold on to democracy as a normative ideal when approaching the boundary question about justified inclusion (the ‘B question’), whatever solution we come up with, it must be compatible with the basic conditions of democracy (the ‘C question’, i.e. what conditions must an arrangement fulfil in order to be democratic?)." p535

"On the narrower exogenous view, the boundary problem is considered to be a question to which democratic theory is not supposed to offer an answer" p535

"On the broader endogenous view, by contrast, the boundary question is seen as internal to democratic theory in the sense that answers to this question also rest on democratic theory" p535

> She extends the All Coerced Principle

"The equal influence principle states that ‘all those who are systematically and over time subjected to the exercise of political power (authority) and to its laws, political decisions and rules, should systematically and over time have an equal influence in the decision making’" p536 

> The C question needs to come first vice other theorists.

"Most importantly, from the fact that the B question is causally and empirically prior, it does not follow that it is also normatively prior." p536

"if we adopt the broader endogenous view of democratic theory when approaching the B question, we need a pair of ‘democratic glasses’, specifying at least the basic requirements for an arrangement to qualify as minimally democratic (answering the C question), in order to know where to look" p536

"equal decision power also involves what we might call a ‘teleological’ dimension, in that people rule over themselves only if they, at least a sufficient number of them, act politically by ‘exercising’ their political equality." p536

Democracy requires that people bind themselves equally to each other. p536

"it is not clear how [all-affected-interests] is able to get us from a conception of moral equality in terms of counting all interests equally, to political equality in terms of the equal political power." p536

"Hence, while the all affected principle might be used as a justification of democratic borders as part of a moral theory, e.g. a theory of justice, it is difficult to see how it can translate by itself its moral egalitarian underpinnings into equal political influence." p536

Contexts of interdependent interests: the "circumstances in which the realization of nearly all of the fundamental interests of a person is connected with the realization of nearly all fundamental interests of others" p541

"The condition of interdependent interests on my account does not justify any normative criteria of democratic inclusion – this work is done by the equal influence principle – it only justifies the applicability of democracy as a normative ideal." p541

> interdependent interests place a constraint on over inclusion.  

> The all-affected interest principle may not justify suffrage or inclusion but it does justify consideration.

"In sum, on the defended account, political legitimacy requires the fulfilment of the principle of political legitimacy, which is applicable in contexts of arbitrary rule, while democratic legitimacy requires the fulfilment of the equal influence principle, which is applicable in contexts of interdependent interests" p543


> Erman's argument has very strong parallels with @song2012's but suffers the same objections.
> 
>  - all affected principle ignores the conditions of democracy
>  - democracy requires equality and equality demands a different prinicple
>  - both however, fail to answer the question of who should be bounded by what
