Whelan outlines the boundary problem as "the logically prior and in some ways more fundamental question of the appropriate constitution of the _people_ or unit within which democratic governance is to be practised." p13

It is not a problem of geographic per se, "but the membership of the democratic body; or citizenry;" p14

He position is "not only that the drawing of boundaries around these units is a significant problem for democratic theory and practice, but that democratic theory itself offers no clear guidance on the matter."  The boundary problem "thus present(s) an important practical limit to the scope of democracy as a method of making collective decisions." p13

"Democracy is advanced by its advocates as the sole legitimate method for making political decisions..." but the boundary problem "...is insoluble within the framework of democratic theory..." p16 making "controversies over boundaries among the most intractable and bitter types of political conflict." p40

There is also "the second problem that the establishment of boundaries ... generally predetermines the outcomes of substantive political issues." p41


#### Argument Outline (p13)

1. Democracy always makes reference to a determinate community of people who are collectively self-governing. 
2. All democratic theory faces the logically prior question of who the people should be.
3. This problem places an important and practical limit on the scope of democracy as a collective decision making method. Who the people are often determines the outcome of any voting system.

Typical accounts of democracy are participatory, majoritarian or consent based.  But each of these accounts needs to answer the logically prior question of who will participate, who will be counted towards the majority or whose consent is needed. (p14--15)

Boundary drawing and determination of political membership is perhaps the most fundamental political decision. Yet, it is a problem completely insoluble from within the framework of democratic theory. p16

Effective democracies require broad consensus on fundamental matters of inclusion. Their boundaries must be recognised as fair and appropriate. p41


#### All-Affected Principle

Intuitively, all those affected by some policy ought have a voice in making it. (p16) The intuition is clear when burdens are to be imposed but not so clear that those receiving benefits ought have a say in the matter. (p17)

Yet, every decision affects people differently. Constituency would need to be determined on a per issue basis. p19

Deeper still, determining who is affected by an issue requires a prior determination of constituency, which cannot be made by those affected as this is the very question to be settled. p19


#### Territorial States

The people can be defined by historical accident - those in a state are the people. But this can't solve the boundary problem when territorial issues are in dispute.

"Democracy can be practiced for making collective decisions once the collectivity has been defined, but democratic methods themselves are inadequate to establish the bounds of the collectivity, whose existence democratic theory simple pre-supposes." p22


#### Consent

Constituting by consent would define the people as who ever consents to being one of them.  This is plausible for voluntary organisations but requires unanimity on who is included and who is excluded. p26

But States are territorial and compulsory associations whose agreement is never unanimous. 


#### Nationality

Nationality and ethnicity have also been suggested as ways to demarcate the people - the UN recognises the right of self-determination for peoples.  The objections to these are many:

- "No single objective criterion of nationality appears definitive." p29
- States govern many nations of people.
- State determine nations as much as nations determine states ie the Soviet people, the Yugoslavian people.
- People may wish to align themselves non-ethnically.
- The nationalist principle is non-voluntaristic. 

These reasons seem to clash with democratic values such s voluntarism, freedom and rationality. p31


#### Geography & Salience

Human distribution seems to drive grouping and connection. Those closest share common ends. Yet...

Physical features are a matter of perspective. Rivers divide as much as unite communities. Mountains are boarders only to those who live on the plains. p37
Economic patterns develop in response to political boundaries, just as much as they form common bonds. p35


#### Autonomy

Size of a democratic people determines both its citizen effectiveness and system capacity (see Dahl 1973 Size & Democracy).  Yet autonomy suffers the same problem as the all-affected principle - constituting the people on a per-issue basis, or changing them over time.

These other principles fail to 'command general respect' p40

## @song2012

Song defines the boundary problem as the question of "who are the people? How is the demos constituted and by what authority?" p39

Her position is cosmopolitan approaches to the boundary problem "are insufficiently attentive to the conditions of democracy. Democracy is not merely a set of procedures; it also consists of substantive values and principles." p39

"Whelan is [only] right that we are caught in a vicious circle _if_ we assume that democracy is purely procedural" p42

The Argument:

  1.  Affected Interest (AI) & Subject to Coercion (SC) view democracy as overly procedural
  2.  Democracy also includes ideals like political equality and solidarity
  3.  AI & SC undermine those ideals by creating problems of size and stability.
  4.  Therefore AI & SC are not suitable basis for bounding the demos.

She then outlines three considerations for bounding the demos: (p39)

  1. securing the constitutive conditions of democracy, 
  2. serving as the primary site of solidarity conducive to democratic participation, and 
  3. establishing clear links between representatives and their constituents.

Typical accounts that legitimate the people include:

- nationalism (see Walzer 1985)
- history (see Nasstrom 2007)
- affected interests (see Shapiro 1999, Young 2000, Gould 2004, Goodin 2007)
- subject to coercion (see Lopez-Guerra 2005, Abizadeh 2008)

Defining the demos as the state is both over and under inclusive. Over, because many not affected are given a say & under because resident aliens are not. p40

> She calls AI & SC "democratic principles of inclusion" (p40) but they would be better characterised as cosmopolitan.

Normative core of democracy includes ideals as well as processes. AI & SC accounts treat democracy as procedural. p41

Political equality & solidarity are normative cores of democracy that are adversely affected by the AI & SC. p43

"The fundamental moral presumption of democracy is that no person is intrinsically superior to another" p43

"Democracy is a collective decision making process subject to the condition of equality" p43

  - but is the equality required amongst all those subject to law or merely those who make the law?
  - does this require equality between ruler and subject?

Political equality requires protecting equal rights and liberties and ensuring equal opportunities for political influence.

The ideal deliberative procedure seeks to filter nonpublic claims from claims orientated to the common good. p44

Deliberative accounts are based on the exchange of reasons acceptable to others with different views and require the protection of nonpolitical rights as a constitutive element of democracy. p45

She makes an interesting distinction between liberal (hypothetical)justifications and democratic (actual) justifications of coercion. p51

The size of a polity inversely affects the solidarity of its people. p55  As well its stability. p56  These concerns undermine democratic solidarity.

"What the affected interests and coercion principles actually require is different demoi for different decisions." p56

Mutual trust and solidarity "provide a prima facie case for a territorial answer to the boundary problem." p59

> AI & SC are highly inclusionary and uneven. People are affected differently.  But democratic equality requires equal voice. Thus they are incompatible.

> Song completely misses the point.  Yes the demos should be bounded by the state but she doesn't explain which state should bound which demos!
