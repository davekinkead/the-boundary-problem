Whelan outlines the boundary problem as "the logically prior and in some ways more fundamental question of the appropriate constitution of the _people_ or unit within which democratic governance is to be practised." p13

It is not a problem of geographic per se, "but the membership of the democratic body; or citizenry;" p14

He position is "not only that the drawing of boundaries around these units is a significant problem for democratic theory and practice, but that democratic theory itself offers no clear guidance on the matter."  The boundary problem "thus present(s) an important practical limit to the scope of democracy as a method of making collective decisions." p13

"Democracy is advanced by its advocates as the sole legitimate method for making political decisions..." but the boundary problem "...is insoluble within the framework of democratic theory..." p16 making "controversies over boundaries among the most intractable and bitter types of political conflict." p40

There is also "the second problem that the establishment of boundaries ... generally predetermines the outcomes of substantive political issues." p41
