## Abstract

The Boundary Problem - how do we decide who ought be include in a demos - affects political theory in a number of different ways, each of which has different consequences depending on one's perspective and intent.  I outline three perspectives common in the literature - the democrat, the cosmopolitan, and the anarchist - and argue that while currently proposed solutions may solve the problem from any one perspective, none can solve it form all perspectives.

Currently a very rough brain dump of thoughts, suitable only for general discussion and ridicule.


## An Outline

- what's the boundary problem
- 3 perspectives
- why the BP is a problem for each perspective
- why each solution works for some but not all perspectives
  - only need to examine plausable solutions here!


### The Democrat

The democrat is primarily concerned with answering the question democratically.  For the proceduralist, the Boundary Problem is a true paradox.  But for the substantive democrat, the question can be answered by any process at realises substantive democratic aims such as equality or autonomy.

- Arrhenius??
- Bergström
- Miller?
- Schaffer
- Song
- Erman??
- Espejo


### The Cosmopolitan

The cosmopolitan's chief concern is whether the answer accords with normative principles that aren't limited to are particular people.  The cosmopolitan rejects claims to nationalism, culture or the status quo but can answer the question by identifying some universal principle of inclusion: the all affected principle, justice, welfare, autonomy or equality.

- Saunders
- Erman?

### The Anarchist

The anarchist is concerned with how any answer affects democracy's ability to legitimate political authority.  Questions of inclusion undermine some democratic accounts of legitimacy making but not others.  So the anarchist is content with any answer whereby the account of democratic inclusion is congruent with the account of democratic authority.

## Solutions

### Democracy

Any procedurally democratic solution leads to an infinite regress and founding paradox.  There can be no democracy without a _demos_.  All democratic procedures require the identification of some specified _demos_ by whom any _kratos_ is wielded.  So answering the question of who should be included in the demos democratically first requires the identification of some prior group to decide that questions.  And who should make up this group? Answering that question requires the identification of another prior group _ad infinitum_.

So the question can't be answered democratically which rules it out for all three perspectives.  But this is only true if we think in democracy in procedural terms.  Democracy however, is much more than just voting or deliberation.  It's also the realisation of substantive ideals such as political equality, popular sovereignty, or even autonomy.

Are there any procedurally non-democratic yet substantively democratic ways of identifying a demos?  Perhaps, and if so these would be acceptable to the Democrat, and perhaps even to the Cosmopolitan, but it's unlikely they would be acceptable to the Anarchist.  This is because few justifications of democratic authority rely on appeals to substantive democratic ideals for the simple reason that they lack what AJ Simmons calls the _particularity requirement_ - why our allegence is owed to this democratic authority rather than another.

### No Solution

One approach to the Boundary Problem is to simply deny it is a problem.  Joeseph Schumpter has argued that no solution is needed because each demos will have it's own belief about how properly demarcate itself, and as long as this process is democratic, then there is no problem.

Well, the no-solution solution is no solution at all.  According to Schumpter, as long as those deciding the boundaries do so democratically, then all is well.  Even if answer to _who the people are_ turns out to include many more than were permitted to decide.  This is akin to saying that as long as a Junta is internally democratic, then a military dictatorship is also democratic.  So while Schumpter may be prepared to bite this bullet, few other democratic theorists would, making it unacceptable to any perspective.

### History

Another approach is to rely on history and accept the status quo. That the borders of yesterday should be the borders of today.  And this it turns out, is how most _peoples_ are actually demarcated.

But the worry with this is obvious. Why should the accidents of history answer what is an important normative question?  How does these morally arbitrary partitions of people into peoples provide any normative foundations for the subsequent claims of democratic theory?  Again, this solution is no solution.

### nationalism
### salience
### consent
### autonomy

### all coerced

### all affected

A promising approach is know as the All-Affected-Principle (AAP) which essentially states that anyone affected by the outcome of a decision should have some say in that decision.  Improperly bounded _demoi_ denied restorative justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.
