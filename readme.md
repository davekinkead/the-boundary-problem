## Abstract

I argue that the Boundary Problem affects political theory in a number of different ways, each with different consequences.

## Outline

- What's the Boundary Problem?

- The problem of justice. Any normative account 

- The problem of theory.  The question can't be answered democratically

- The problem of legitimacy.  Many accounts of democracy justify the authority of a democratic state on consequentialist grounds.  The Boundary problem undermines these accounts.
