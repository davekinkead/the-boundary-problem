## Abstract

I argue that the Boundary Problem affects political theory in a number of different ways, each with different consequences.

Currently a very rough brain dump of thoughts, suitable only for general discussion and ridicule.

## An Outline

## The Problem

  - history
  - democratic regress
  - non-democratic ideals
    - history
    - nationalism
    - salience
    - consent
    - autonomy
    - all affected
    - all coerced

### The Democrat

The democrat is primarily concerned with answering the question democratically.  For the proceduralist, the Boundary Problem is a true paradox.  But for the substantive democrat, the question can be answered by any process at realises substantive democratic aims such as equality or autonomy.


### The Cosmopolitan

The cosmopolitan's chief concern is whether the answer accords with their extra-democratic principles.  The cosmopolitan rejects claims to nationalism, culture or the status quo but can answer the question by identifying some universal principle of inclusion: the all affected principle, justice, welfare, autonomy or equality.


### The Anarchist

The anarchist is concerned with how any answer affects democracy's ability to legitimate political authority.  Questions of inclusion undermine some democratic accounts of legitimacy making but not others.  So the anarchist is content with any answer whereby the account of democratic inclusion is congruent with the account of democratic authority.


## Conflict of perspective

Whether or not an answer to the question of inclusion solves the Boundary Problem depends on the position one holds on the Boundary Problem's impact.
